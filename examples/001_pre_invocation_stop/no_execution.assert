ASSERT: No Execution Occurred

Decision ID: jdg-001-20260117-001
Timestamp: 2026-01-17T12:00:00Z

No model invocation occurred.
No execution context was created.
No inference was performed.
No output was generated.
No rollback was required because nothing ran.

This assertion is backed by:
- gate_decision.json (decision record)
- trace_proof.json (enforcement proof)
- absence of execution logs
- absence of model invocation records

The lack of execution logs is not an error.
It is evidence of successful restraint.

STOP was the outcome.
Non-execution is the proof.
